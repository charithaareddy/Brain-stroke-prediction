# Brain Stroke Prediction ðŸ§ 

This project predicts stroke risk using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  
Dataset is taken from Kaggle. Random Forest gave highest accuracy: **94%**.

## Tools
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- Data preprocessing & encoding
- Class imbalance handling using `class_weight='balanced'`
- Model comparison with accuracy and ROC curves
